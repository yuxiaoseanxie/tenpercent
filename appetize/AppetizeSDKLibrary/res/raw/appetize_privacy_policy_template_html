        <p class="answer">This privacy policy (this "Policy") describes the collection of personal information by Appetize, LLC, a California corporation ("Appetize," "we," or "us") from users of our Web site at www.appetizeapp.com (the "Website"), as well as all related applications, widgets, software, tools, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Website, our "Services").  This Policy also describes our use and disclosure of such information.  By using our Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this Policy.  This Policy is incorporated by reference into the Appetize Terms of Use [link] and subject to the provisions of the Terms of Use.</p>

        <p class="question">Personal Information</p>

            <p class="answer">"Personal Information," as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual&rsquo;s name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.  Personal Information also includes information about an individual&rsquo;s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Services, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.<br>
            Personal Information does not include "aggregate" or other non-personally identifiable information.  Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.  We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.</p>

        <p class="question">Collection of Information</p>

            <p class="answer">&bull;	E-mail Newsletters.  We may offer e-mail newsletters from time to time on our Services.  If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.
            &bull;	User Accounts and Profiles.  Our Services may give you the ability to register for an Appetize account or to create and update a user profile on the applicable Service.  If we offer user account or profile functionality on the Services, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering for an account or creating or updating a user profile.  This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you.  We may indicate that some personal information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional.<br>
            &bull;	Integrated Services.  You may be given the option to access or register for the Services through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each an "Integrated Service"), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect.  By doing this, you authorize us to access and store the credentials you provide, your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy.  You should check your Facebook or other Integrated Service privacy settings to understand and change the information sent to us through Facebook Connect or other Integrated Services.  Please review each Integrated Service&rsquo;s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Services.<br>
            &bull;	Interactive Features.  Our Services may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Services, post comments to forums, to upload photographs and other content (the "User Materials"), participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Services and with other users.  If you use any interactive functionality on our Services that request or permit you to provide us with personal information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Services), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.<br>
            &bull;	Correspondence.  If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Services, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.<br>
            &bull;	Contests and Sweepstakes.  We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Services.  Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners.  In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us.  The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such personal information.<br></p>

        <p class="question">Passive Information Collection</p>

            <p class="answer">When you visit our Services, some information is collected automatically.  For example, when you access our Services, we automatically collect your browser&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Services (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Services, the actions you take on our Services, and the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on our Services.  We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.<br>
            We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as "Web beacons").  We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on our Services, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to you.  If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy.  Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.<br>
            Also, please be aware that third parties, such as companies displaying advertisements on the Services or sites or services provided by third parties ("Third-Party Sites") that may be linked to from the Services, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services, Third-Party Sites or content.  We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.</p>

                <p class="answer">Some features on our Services may allow you to upload, post, or otherwise transmit User Materials to public areas of the Services, such as content that you post in a public profile on the Services.  We may make these User Materials available for display upon Appetize properties that are not governed by this Policy, as well as to services operated by third parties that display content from the Website (collectively, "Syndicated Services").  Please be aware that any Personal Information that you include within any User Materials will be made available to other users of the Services, and to users of Syndicated Services, who view it.  You include Personal Information in User Materials at your sole risk.  We may allow you to select privacy options that limit access to some types of Personal Information in User Materials, but no security measures are impenetrable or perfect.  Additionally, even after information posted on the Website is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Services.  We cannot warrant or guarantee that any Personal Information that you provide on and in connection with the Services will not be accessed, viewed, or used by unauthorized persons.</p>

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third-Party Sites or any products or services on or through them.  Additionally, please be aware that the Services may contain links to Web sites and services that we operate but that are governed by different privacy policies.

                            <p class="answer">Our servers and data centers are located in the United States.  If you choose to use the Services from outside the U.S., then you should know that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into the U.S. for storage and processing. By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Service, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S.  Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services.

Your continued use of our Services after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy.  If we change this Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any Personal Information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective.  We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information.</p>
