Live Nation 2 for Android, the cause and solution of all Live Nation 2 for Android's problems.

Building
========

To build the Live Nation app you will need to install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).

To begin, you will need to clone two repositories onto your computer:

	git clone git@github.com:TeamSidewinder/adr-appLiveNation.git adr-appLiveNation
	git clone git@github.com:TeamSidewinder/adr-libsLabsPlatform.git adr-libsLabsPlatform

Once the repositories have been cloned, you will import the adr-appLiveNation project into Android Studio. After import, you will need to install any required SDK components. _(if you're reading this now, you should write down what components you've installed.)_ It will then be possible to build and run the project.
